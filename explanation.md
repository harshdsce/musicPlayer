# Let's break down the flow of the project step by step in a simple way, using the code. I'll explain each part, focusing on what happens in the code and how it all connects to form the music player.

### Overview:
The project is a simple web music player that allows you to browse albums, select songs, and play them. It has features like play/pause, skip to next/previous song, volume control, and a seekbar to jump to any part of the song.

---

### **1. The Initial Setup**

```javascript
let currentsong = new Audio();  // This creates an empty audio object that will hold the song we are playing.

let songs;  // This variable will hold the list of songs in the current album.
let currfolder;  // This will store the current album folder name.
```

- **currentsong**: This is an instance of the `Audio` object in JavaScript. It lets us control audio playback (like play, pause, volume).
- **songs**: This will store all the songs in the current album folder.
- **currfolder**: This stores the name of the folder of the current album. It's used to fetch songs from the correct folder.

---

### **2. Displaying All Albums**

When the page loads, the `displayalbums()` function fetches and displays all available albums. It will show the album's cover, title, and description.

```javascript
async function displayalbums() {
    let a = await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:5500/songs/`);  // Fetches all albums from the "songs" folder
    let response = await a.text();  // Converts the response to text.
    let div = document.createElement("div");
    div.innerHTML = response;
    let anchors = div.getElementsByTagName("a");  // Gets all the album links.
    let cardcontainer = document.querySelector(".cardcontainer");  // The container where albums will be displayed.

    for (let index = 0; index < anchors.length; index++) {
        const e = anchors[index];

        if (e.href.includes("/songs/")) {
            let folder = e.href.split("/songs/").slice(-1)[0];  // Extracts the folder name (album name) from the URL.
            let a = await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:5500/songs/${folder}/info.json`);  // Fetches album metadata from "info.json".
            let response = await a.json();  // Parses the JSON metadata (e.g., title and description).
            
            cardcontainer.innerHTML = cardcontainer.innerHTML + ` 
            <div data-folder="${folder}" class="card">
                <img src="/songs/${folder}/cover.jpg" alt="Album Cover"> 
                <h2>${response.title}</h2>
                <p>${response.description}</p>
            </div>`;  // Adds the album cover, title, and description to the page.
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- This function **fetches** all the albums available in the `/songs/` directory on the server.
- It then **displays each album** with a card that contains the album cover, title, and description, fetched from the `info.json` file inside each album's folder.
- The `data-folder` attribute holds the name of the folder (album), which will be used to fetch the songs when the album is clicked.

---

### **3. When You Click on an Album**

When you click on an album, the `getsongs()` function is triggered, which will fetch all the songs from the selected album and display them.

```javascript
async function getsongs(folder) {
    currfolder = folder;  // Set the current album folder.
    let a = await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:5500/${folder}/`);  // Fetches the album directory listing.
    let response = await a.text();  // Converts the directory content to text.
    let div = document.createElement("div");
    div.innerHTML = response;
    let as = div.getElementsByTagName("a");  // Extracts the links to the songs.
    songs = [];

    for (let index = 0; index < as.length; index++) {
        const element = as[index];
        if (element.href.endsWith(".mp3")) {  // Only consider .mp3 files as songs.
            songs.push(element.href.split(`/${folder}/`)[1]);  // Adds the song name to the `songs` array.
        }
    }

    let songul = document.querySelector(".songlist").getElementsByTagName("ul")[0];  // The `<ul>` element where the songs will be displayed.
    songul.innerHTML = "";  // Clears the list before adding new songs.

    for (const song of songs) {
        songul.innerHTML = songul.innerHTML + `<li>
            <div class="info">
                <div>${song.replaceAll("%20", " ")}</div>  <!-- Displays the song name -->
            </div>
            <div class="playnow">
                <span>Play Now</span>
            </div>
        </li>`;
    }

    // Adds an event listener to each song in the list.
    Array.from(document.querySelector(".songlist").getElementsByTagName("li")).forEach(e => {
        e.addEventListener("click", () => {
            playmusic(e.querySelector(".info").firstElementChild.innerHTML.trim());  // Plays the song when clicked.
        });
    });

    return songs;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **When an album is clicked**, the function fetches the list of `.mp3` songs in that albumâ€™s folder.
- It **displays each song** in a list format, showing the song name.
- When a song is clicked, it calls the `playmusic()` function to start playing that song.

---

### **4. Playing a Song**

When you click on a song, the `playmusic()` function is triggered to load and play the song.

```javascript
const playmusic = (track, pause = false) => {
    currentsong.src = `/${currfolder}/` + track;  // Sets the audio source to the selected song.
    if (!pause) {
        currentsong.play();  // Plays the song if not paused.
        play.src = "pause.svg";  // Change the play icon to pause.
    }
    document.querySelector(".songinfo").innerHTML = decodeURI(track);  // Shows the song title.
    document.querySelector(".songtime").innerHTML = "00:00/00:00";  // Initializes song time display.
}
```

**Explanation**:
- The `src` of the `currentsong` audio object is updated with the path of the selected song.
- The song starts playing, and the **UI updates** to show the song's title and the current time.

### **5. Playback Controls (Play/Pause, Next/Previous)**

#### **Play/Pause Button**:
```javascript
play.addEventListener("click", () => {
    if (currentsong.paused) {
        currentsong.play();  // Plays the song if it's paused.
        play.src = "pause.svg";  // Change icon to pause.
    } else {
        currentsong.pause();  // Pauses the song if it's playing.
        play.src = "play.svg";  // Change icon to play.
    }
});
```

#### **Next and Previous Buttons**:
```javascript
previous.addEventListener("click", () => {
    let index = songs.indexOf(currentsong.src.split("/").slice(-1)[0]);  // Get current song index.
    if ((index - 1) >= 0) {
        playmusic(songs[index - 1]);  // Play the previous song.
    }
});

next.addEventListener("click", () => {
    let index = songs.indexOf(currentsong.src.split("/").slice(-1)[0]);
    if ((index + 1) < songs.length) {
        playmusic(songs[index + 1]);  // Play the next song.
    }
});
```

**Explanation**:
- **Play/Pause**: If the song is paused, it starts playing, and the button icon changes to a pause icon. If it's playing, it pauses and shows a play icon.
- **Next/Previous**: Clicking these buttons skips to the next or previous song in the list.

---

### **6. Seekbar Functionality**

The seekbar allows users to jump to any part of the song.

```javascript
currentsong.addEventListener("timeupdate", () => {
    document.querySelector(".songtime").innerHTML = `${SecondsToMinutesSeconds(currentsong.currentTime)}/${SecondsToMinutesSeconds(currentsong.duration)}`;  // Update current time and duration.
    document.querySelector(".circle").style.left = (currentsong.currentTime / currentsong.duration) * 100 + "%";  // Move the seekbar circle.
});

document.querySelector(".seekbar").addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    let percent = (e.offsetX / e.target.getBoundingClientRect().width) * 100;  // Calculate clicked percentage.
    document.querySelector(".circle").style.left = percent + "%";  // Update the seekbar circle.
    currentsong.currentTime = (currentsong.duration * percent) / 100;  // Move the song to the clicked position.
});
```

**Explanation**:
- **Time Update**: As the song plays, the `timeupdate` event updates the time and seekbar position.
- **Seekbar Click**: When the user clicks on the seekbar, the song jumps to the position where they clicked.

### **Conclusion**

This is how the music player works:
1. **Displaying Albums**: All albums are fetched and displayed on the page.
2. **Clicking an Album**: When you click an album, its songs are loaded and displayed.
3. **Clicking a Song**: The selected song starts playing, and playback controls like play/pause, next/previous, and seekbar work to control the playback.
